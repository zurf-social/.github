Twitter is what's happening and what people are talking about right now.
It's where news breaks and communities converge.
And it's all powered by open source, made by a team of amazing Tweeps.

## Participating in the community

ðŸ«‚ We aim to create a welcoming and inclusive community. Please note that Twitter's open source projects are governed by our [code of conduct](https://github.com/twitter/.github/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md).
